# CVE-2022-46169 POC
Proof of concept / CTF script for exploiting CVE-2022-46169 in Cacti, versions >=1.2.22

This script was written to solve a CTF challenge.
It was based on the following example scripts - I had difficulty understanding what these scripts actually did, so I re-wrote my own interpretation of them, which helped me understand how the exploit works.
